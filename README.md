# AppOptics APM

The `appoptics-apm` module provides [AppOptics](https://www.appoptics.com/) instrumentation for Node.js.

It supports most commonly used databases, frameworks, and packages automatically. An
API allows anything to be instrumented.

An [AppOptics](https://www.appoptics.com/) account is required to view metrics.
Accounts are [free](https://www.appoptics.com/free-apm-software) for development
and testing use. For production usage a [free trial](https://www.appoptics.com/)
is a great way to start.

## Dependencies

- Linux
- Node.js v8+ [Maintenance and Active LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

The agent compiles a C++ addon during install, so youâ€™ll need to have the following on the system prior to installing the agent:

- gcc version 4.7 and above
- for node-gyp: make and python 2.x (version 2.7 is [recommended](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix))


## Installation

The `appoptics-apm` module is [available on npm](http://npmjs.org/package/appoptics-apm) and can be installed
by navigating to your app root and running:

```
npm install --save appoptics-apm
```

The agent requires a service key, obtained from the AppOptics dashboard under "Organization Details",
to connect to your account.  This is set via the `APPOPTICS_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable, make
sure it is available in the environment where your application is running:

```
export APPOPTICS_SERVICE_KEY="api-token-here:your-service-name"
```

Then, at the top of your main js file for your app, add this:

```
require('appoptics-apm')
```

Now restart your app and you should see data in your AppOptics dashboard in a minute or two.

## Important!

`appoptics-apm` should be the first file required. If, for example, you are using the `esm`
package to enable ES module syntax (import rather than require) and you use the following
command to invoke your program `node -r esm index.js` then `esm.js` is loaded first and
`appoptics-apm` is unable to instrument modules. You can use it, just make sure to require
`appoptics-apm` first, e.g., `node -r appoptics-apm -r esm index.js`.

If you are using the custom instrumentation SDK then appoptics must be loaded in the code
so that a reference to the SDK is obtained, like `const ao = require('appoptics-apm')`. It
is still be possible to use the command line `node -r appoptics-apm -r esm index.js`; the
require in the code will just get a reference to the results of the command line require.

## Configuration

See the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/appoptics/appoptics-apm-node/blob/master/guides/configuration.md)

## Upgrading

To upgrade an existing installation, navigate to your app root and run:
